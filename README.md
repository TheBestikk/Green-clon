## History project
One fine Saturday evening there was a lesson on the course and at the end of the lesson they reminded us about our debts and mentioned a semester project in return for which we suggested to the mentor that if we make the entire semester project in code, then all the debts for 1 semester will disappear. The project has two authors and he is responsible for Our goal is solely to gain experience from the lessons we have completed and also to be interested in whether we can make a website without precise pixels on the layout.
